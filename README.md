## 📌 Project Overview

Increased lifestyle-related diseases demand fast and intelligent healthcare solutions. This system uses supervised machine learning techniques to analyze patient health parameters and **predict multiple diseases concurrently** — providing fast, low-cost, and scalable diagnostic support.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🩺 Predicts **Diabetes** and **Heart Disease** risk
- 📊 Uses **real-world medical datasets** from UCI and Kaggle
- 🧠 Trained using **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost**
- 💡 Implements **data preprocessing, feature selection, model optimization**
- 🌐 Deployed as a **user-friendly web app using Streamlit**
- 🔁 Cross-validation and **model evaluation with accuracy > 84%**
